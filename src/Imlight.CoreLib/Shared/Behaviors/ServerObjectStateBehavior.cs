Notes:

State Catorgories:

A "StateSet" has a number of categories, which have their own independent states. For example. NPCs have a state set "NPCMobileStates,"
which has categories "Fundamental," "Primary," "Locomotive," and "NPCInteracting." Each category has its own set of states.
An object may be in multiple states at once, but only one state per category.

An npc's "fundamental" state may be "Alive," but in the "Locomotive" category, it may be "walking." These states are independent of each other,
but a state change in one category may force a state change in another category. For example, if an NPC dies, it may be forced to stop walking.

States themselves:

A "state" is a specific phase that an object is in. There are states for dead/alive, walking/running/idle, and interacting with objects. Being in a state
may change the object's behavior, like blocking movement or disallowing certain actions. Every time a state changes, the server will
update the client with the new state, so long as the state is not private (_privateState).

There are also state transitions. Each state will declare which states it is capable of transforming into. Some state changes may have an intermediate
state known as a "transition state." Transition states are explicitly declared with the `m_autoTransition` field, and have a `m_transitionTime` field.
When a state is changed to a state that has a transition state, the object will first enter the transition state, then the final state.

Entering a state may also play an animation.

A state also has a number of blocked states that it cannot be in while that state is active. The blocked states extend beyond the category of the state.
