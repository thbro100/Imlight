 * ========================================================================
 * SERVER FRIEND BEHAVIOR
 * ========================================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Manages player friend requests, buddy list, and relationship status.
 * 
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Flow to adding a friend:
    1. Player A clicks on player B's character and selects "Add Friend".
        Player A sends GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD to the server. Player A keeps track of player B's ID.
    2. Server forwards the request to player B with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADDFWD.
    3. Player B receives the request, and adds it to their pending friend requests. They will see a notification in the client.
    4. Player B can now accept or deny the request.
        a. If they accept, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT to the server.
        b. If they deny, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY to the server.
    5. Server forwards the response to player A with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTREPLYFWD. If the sender
         is offline, we will have to go to the database directly to add the friend.
    6. Player A receives the response. If the response is an acceptance, they will add the friend to their list.
        Player A's game client will see a notification that the friend request has been accepted.
